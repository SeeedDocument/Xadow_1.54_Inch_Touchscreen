# Xadow 1.54'' Touchscreen
## Introduction
This TFT Display contains 240 x 240 pixels that can be controlled individually to display up to 262K colors. Above the display is a layer of a capacitive touchscreen, offering 29.4mm x 29.4mm active area at the center of the display. As a single touch screen, it can detect finger presses anywhere within the active area during normal operations. The TFT driver gets the ST7789S IC Driver inside with 2-bit data and 4-bit control serial interface while the capacitive touchscreen controller uses I2C.

## Note

- Try to use it in a stable environment as an abrupt variation of temperature and humidity may cause malfunction of the panel.
- Try to keep the panel surface clean and avoid any adhesive applied on the surface, you may use neutral detergent or isopropyl alcohol on a clean, soft cloth to clean the panel surface.
- Note we have few modifications to library of Xadow 1.54" Touchscreen for newer version. If you use Xadow 1.54" Touchscreen v1.1:
  - For development environment of JavaScript, Lua, and Arduino or using - RePhone Create Kit source code, you need to comment the corresponding line #define _TOUCH_SCREEN_V1_0_ and un-comment(enable) the line //#define _TOUCH_SCREEN_V1_1_. You can find those corresponding lines at:
    - https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Arduino_IDE_for_RePhone/blob/master/hardware/arduino/mtk/libraries/LDisplay/utility/lcd_sitronix_st7789s.h.

We’ve been looking for a better place where our backers (RePhone Users) can sit together, warmly and comfortably, have conversations about RePhone, discuss technical problems, share ideas/projects, and give feedback on the modules’ development in the future. And then here we go, the RePhone Community.

Now join us in the RePhone Community! Together we seek answers, make interesting stuff, care about each other, and share our experiences.
